Attention classification and neural entrainment BCI 

Attention is a limited cognitive resource; in our increasingly distraction rich-environments, controlling and sustaining focus has become more difficult. We propose a brain-computer interface (BCI) that uses EEG-based attention classification to detect inattention, paired with neural entrainment system designed to optimize attentional engagement.

Our goal is to develop a data-driven understanding of how attentional processes respond to different types of distractors. The long-term objective is to design closed-loop neural entrainment interventions, using auditory or visual stimuli, to gently guide individuals back into optimal focus states.

This has potential applications in education, mental health and productivity, particularly in settings where attention is critical.
